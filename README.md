# PrettyHyur RebornBuddy Profiles
## These profiles are available to use within RebornBuddy in the OrderBot Botbase.

#### Most of my profiles utilise the use of **[ExBuddy](https://github.com/Entrax643/ExBuddy)** in some way.
#### Be sure to have **ExBuddy** installed by placing the *ExBuddy* folder from the repository above in your **plugins** folder where RebornBuddy is installed.

Most of my profiles are created from a combination of copy / pasting from other seasoned professionals (such as **[sodimm](https://github.com/sodimm)** and **[y2krazy](https://github.com/y2krazy)**) and learning from mistakes.

There are 2 methods to get my profiles and keep them up to date;

* Use GIT or SVN: click the Clone or Download button on the top right of the homepage and copy the repo URL in to your GIT or SVN client of choice.
* Download the ZIP using the Clone or Download button on the top right of the homepage and extract the files to somewhere. I would recommend creating a profiles folder in your RebornBuddy folder and placing them there.

I would highly recommend SVN or GIT as you can update with as little as 2 clicks.
